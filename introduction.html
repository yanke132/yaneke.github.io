                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) was a nonfermented, oxidase-negative
                                gram-negative bacterium
                                that was considered an opportunistic pathogen that primarily infected nosocomial
                                patients [1,2,3].
                                It has become an increasingly prevalent major bacteria for the nosocomial bloodstream
                                infections
                                (BSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical site infections [4]. In children,
                                primary disease, immunodeficiency, use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials and aggressive
                                manipulation have led
                                to an increase in the incidence of bloodstream infection.

                                Our hospital was a tertiary children’s hospital, and one of the characteristics of the
                                intensive
                                care unit of our hospital was that there are half patients with critical hematological
                                tumors, and
                                our clinical perception was that the early mortality is very high for hematological
                                malignancy
                                patients with Acinetobacter baumannii- bloodstream infection (AB-BSI).

                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In adult patients with hematological tumors, the 7-day mortality was 72%, and
                                the 30-day mortality was even as high as 96% [6], which was consistent with our clinical
                                practice.
                                Previous studies in adults and children have proposed previous exposure to carbapenems,
                                hospitalization time of ICU, invasive procedures performed, severity of the disease, red
                                blood cell
                                distribution width, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and neutropenia were risk factors for the
                                mortality of
                                AB-BSI [7,8,9,10,11,12]. In order to provide early prognostic indicators
                                for clinical.
                                practice, this study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of children with AB-BSI
                                within 24 h.after the onset, aiming to find early warning indicators and the optimal
                                cut-off of
                                these
                                indicators, so as to improve vigilance, active intervention, and ultimately reduce the
                                mortality of
                                children.

                        <p class="text-muted" style="font-size: 20px;">Of the 37 children with AB-BSI included in this
                            study, 23 were males and 14 were females, with a median age of 4.83 (0.60 to 10.15) years,
                            and there were no significant differences in gender and age between these two groups. Among
                            these patients, 18 died (48.65%, 18/37) and 19 survived (51.35%, 19/37). The dead group had
                            a significantly higher incidence of respiratory failure (p = 0.008), shock (p = 0.000), MODS
                            (p = 0.000), neutropenia (< 1.5 × 109 /L) (p = 0.000) and serious neutropenia
                                (< 0.5 × 109/L) (p = 0.000) than those in the survival group. In the 2 weeks before
                                onset, 94.59% (35/37) of the children had 1 or more invasive procedures, of which 64.87%
                                (24/37) had 2 or more invasive procedures. The children in the death group had
                                significantly more invasive procedures (2 or more) than those in the survival group in 2
                                weeks before the onset of infection (p = 0.005). The number of people requiring
                                endotracheal intubation (p = 0.045), deep vein catheterization (p = 0.000) and
                                indwelling urinary catheters (p = 0.019) were significantly higher in the death group
                                than that in the survival group, but there was no significant difference between the two
                                groups in invasive procedures such as abdominal/thoracic drainage, PICC/PORT, CRRT,
                                ECMO, and gastrointestinal endoscopy. The median length of hospital stay before onset
                                was 22 (10, 36) days, and the median length of total hospital stay was 57 (33.5,105)
                                days, of which 78.38% (29/37) had total hospital stay more than 30 days. The source of
                                pathogen from ICU ward (including PICU, NICU, SICU) accounted for 86.49% (32/37), and
                                that from general ward was 13.51% (5/37). The proportion of multidrug-resistant (also
                                carbapenem-resistance) AB in the death group was significantly higher than that in the
                                survival group (p = 0.000), while the PICS score was significantly lower in the survival
                                group than that in the death group (p = 0.000). There was no significant difference in
                                effective antibiotic use within 24 h between the two groups (p = 0.295) (Table 1)</p>

                    <p class="text-muted" style="font-size: 20px;">AB bacteremia has a high mortality in children,
                        especially in patients with
                        hematological diseases and oncology. Many early indicators were associated with poor prognosis,
                        while elevated CRP and neutropenia were the independent predictors for the 30-day mortality of
                        children with laboratory-confirmed AB bacteremia.</p>
